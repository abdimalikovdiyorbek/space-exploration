# Space Exploration
Small good-looking website for SpaceX!

## Purpose
Another project made for Scrimba's HTML & CSS course.

## Features
- Get blessed by the beautifulness of my website
- Includes a lot of things every web developer should know

## Languages
- HTML
- CSS

## Key Takeaways

- This is purely fan-made website
- Everything said on the website is fake, just for decoration
- I recommend to view the site in minimized window (box-shaped)
